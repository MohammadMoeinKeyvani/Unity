# Unity
A repo to share my unity sample
# Number Wizard Console Game
It's a simple console game(it hasn't any UI, character and ...) that every one who know programing can create it simply without unity,but I do it on the unity to be unique! :)
# Text Base Game
It hasn't any story (Because I'm not a writer -_-) , But it can run and also play :)
